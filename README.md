# Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in depth

The goal of this repository is to go into the fundamentals of models and try to do the following.
1. Implement models from scratch, that is, without any library
2. Implement models using library to gain a perspective of how easy it is deploy such models
3. Implement the models in a framework such as pyTorch, this would help in getting a better understanding of the framework and its features

This sounds like a lot of of repetitive work, however, this would lead to getting a well round understanding of the topics
The repo will cover Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Deep learning models related to NLP and LLMs
